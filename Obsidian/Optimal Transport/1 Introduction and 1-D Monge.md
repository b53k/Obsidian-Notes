## Introduction üîç
### Monge Formulation
Back in the $18^{\text{th}}$ century, Gaspard #Monge wanted to find an optimal way to transport/rearrange a pile of dirt into castle walls or other desired shapes. Later this task was coined as Monge's problem. Mathematically,$$\begin{aligned}
\text{optimize} &= \min_{T}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \text{c}(x,T(x))f(x)dx\\  &= \min_{T}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \big|T(x) - x\big|f(x)dx 
\end{aligned}$$ where, $T(x)$ is some optimal transformation of $x$ , and sometimes the cost $c(x,T(x))$ is replaced by | . | --a distance metric. 
* In general, instead of working directly with probability densities we want to setup the problem up using measures. Let $\mu$ be a source measure and $\nu$ be a target measure. For example, $\mu(X)$ tells us how much mass is present in the set $X$.
* Since we are simply transporting the mass from one measure to another, the total mass should be constant. $$\mu(\mathbb{R}^N) = \nu(\mathbb{R}^N)$$Lot of the times the total mass is 1 and also often interpreted as probability measures.
* Now we seek the transport map $T(x)$ where source is supported on $X$ and target on $Y$. $$T:X \to Y$$
* Furthermore, we want to conserve mass not only globally but also locally.<br>Let $A$ be a subset in $\nu(Y)$ and if we want to find where it came from in the set $\mu(X)$; we can take $T^{-1}(A)$. Since, we the local mass is conserved; the following needs to be true: $$\mu(T^{-1}(A)) = \nu(A)\space  \space \space \forall A \in Y$$Here; $\mu(T^{-1}(A))$ is called the #push-forward of $\mu$ through $T$. This is denoted by $T_{\#} \mu$ !![[Pasted image 20230112002514.png]]$$\large{\therefore T_{\#}\mu = \nu} \ \ \ (\text{aka mass conservation})$$
* Therefore the #Monge formulation of #Optimal-Transport is the following:$$\min \Big\{ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}c(x, T(x))\ \ d\mu(x) \ \big|T_{\#}\mu = \nu \Big\}$$ Here, $d\mu(x)$ weights how much mass we're removing from $X$ at a time.<br>Some issues that we may face when solving the above formulation are; feasibility and uniqueness of solution, stability, and figuring out a suitable cost function. Most of the time quadratic cost is often sought after. For example, in Book-moving problem, the cost $c(x,y) = |x-y|$ does not provide a unique solution but $c(x,y) = \frac{1}{2}|x-y|^2$ provides a unique solution. 

### Limitation of Monge's Formulation
In mines and factories setting, the number of mines does not necessarily have to equal to the number of factories. If we want to split a single mass(1) source into two targets each with mass $\large \frac{1}{2}$ ; the transformation $T(X)$ does not allow for splitting of the original mass. Clearly, #Monge formulation of the optimal transport doesn't work in this setting.

#Kantorovich formulation allows us to generalize the #Monge formulation. Kantorovich problem aims to seek a transport plan rather than a transport map which allows for the mass to go to different places i.e. it allows the mass to be split.

We have a source measure $\large \mu$ supported on $X$ and a target measure $\large \nu$ supported on $Y$. We now want to learn how much mass gets moved from $\large x$ to $\large y$. We store this information in another measure called $\large \pi$ and is defined on product space $X \times Y$.

For example, suppose there is a mine at $\large x = 0$ with 1 unit of resource and also a factory at $y = 0, 1$ with $\large \frac{1}{3}$ and $\large \frac{2}{3}$ units of resources respectively. Here;$$\begin{align}
\pi(0,0) &= \frac{1}{3} \\
\pi(0,1) &= \frac{2}{3}
	\end{align}$$ As a side note here, $\pi(0,\mathbb{R}) = 1$. In general, let $A \subset X$ and $B \subset Y$, then $\pi(A,B)$ tells us how much mass is transported from $A$ to $B$.

Consider $x \in X$, and $\pi(x, Y)$ (quantifies how much mass is transported from a point $x$ to all the potential targets in $Y$). By the conservation of mass, we can write.$$\pi(x, Y) = \mu(x)$$ More generally, $\pi(A,Y) = \mu(A)$ and we say that $\mu$ is the marginal of $\pi$ on $X$. Similarly, when $\pi(X,B) = \nu(B)$, we say $\nu$ is the marginal of $\pi$ on $Y$.  

#### Kantorovich Formulation
We know the cost $c(x,y)$ is weighted by the amount of mass we're moving from $x$ to $y$. $$\inf \int_{X \times Y} c(x,y)\ d\pi(x,y) \big| \pi \in \Pi(\mu, \nu)$$ Here, $\Pi(\mu, \nu)$ consists of measures whose marginals on $X$ and $Y$ are $\mu$ and $\nu$ respectively.

##### Special Cases:
* Discrete Optimal Transport: Dirac masses $\to$ Dirac masses
* Continuous Optimal Transport: $\mu$ and $\nu$ are continuous functions with densities $f$ and $g$ respectively
* Semi-discrete Optimal Transport: $\mu$ is absolutely continuous and $\nu$ consists of Dirac mass

## Monge's Formulation in 1-D
Goal: Find $T(x)$ for $$\min \frac{1}{2} \int_\mathbb{R} (x - T(x))^2 \ f(x) dx\ \ \ \ \ \text{s.t} \ \ \ \int_{T^{-1}(A)}f(x)dx = \int_A g(y)\ dy\ \ \forall \ A \subset \mathbb{R}$$
In simple terms, the constraint part tells us that the mass $A$ in the source must be equal to the mass in the target region.
Alternatively,$$\int_X h(T(x))\ f(x)\ dx = \int_Y h(y)\ g(y)\ dy \ \ \ \forall \ h \in C^0(X)$$
The above expression tells us that given any function $h$, the map $T(x)$ should preserve measure and also preserves what happens when we integrate over $y$.

### Properties of optimal map
Pick two points, $\large x_1$ and $\large x_2$ such that $\large x_1 < x_2$ and $\large \epsilon >0$. Make two little open intervals $x_1 \in I_1$, $x_2 \in I_2$ s.t. $$\int_{I_1}f(x)\ dx = \int_{I_2}f(x)\ dx =  \large \epsilon$$ i.e. total mass on $I_1$ is the same as total mass on $I_2$. 

![[Pasted image 20230111131956.png]]
Here, $y_i = T(x_i)$ and $J_i = T(I_i)$.

Let's 'permute' part of the map and create a new measure-preserving map s.t.$$\begin{align} 
\widetilde{T}(x_1) = y_2, \ \ \ \widetilde{T}(x_2) = y_1 \\
\widetilde{T}(I_1) = J_2, \ \ \ \widetilde{T}(I_2) = J_1 \\
\widetilde{T}(x) = T(x) \ \  \text{if} \ x \notin I_1 \cup I_2
\end{align}$$ Now, under 'nice assumptions', if $T$ was optimal.$$\begin{align}
\frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathbb{R}} (x-T(x))^2\ f(x) dx &\leq \frac{1}{2} \int_{\mathbb{R}} (x-\widetilde{T}(x))^2\ f(x) dx \\
\Rightarrow -\int_{I_1}xT(x)f(x)dx -\int_{I_2}xT(x)f(x)dx &\leq -\int_{I_1}x\widetilde T(x)f(x)dx - \int_{I_2}x\widetilde T(x)f(x)dx \\
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{\epsilon} \int_{I_1} x\big(\widetilde T(x) - T(x)\big)\ f(x)\ dx &+ \frac{1}{\epsilon} \int_{I_2} x\big(\widetilde T(x) - T(x)\big)\ f(x)\ dx \leq 0 \\
\end{align}$$
As $\epsilon \to 0$: $$\begin{align}
x_1(y_2 - y_1) + x_2(y_1 - y_2) &\leq 0 \\
\Rightarrow (y_2 - y_1)(x_2 - x_1) &\geq 0
\end{align}$$ Since, $x_1 \leq x_2$ the above expression tells that the quantity $(y_2 - y_1)$ is positive. In other words, in the case of quadratic cost, the optimal transport map is a #monotone function in $\mathbb{R}$.

### Can we construct a monotone map?
We use Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) to construct the monotone map $T(x)$. 
Here,$$\begin{align}
F(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\large x} f(t)dt \ \ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ G(y) = \int_{-\infty}^{\large y} g(t)dt
\end{align}$$ We expect, $F(x) = G\big[T(x)\big]$ so we get an exact solution via $T(x) = G^{-1}F(x)$.
